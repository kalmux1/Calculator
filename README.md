## Overview

This project is a simple yet powerful calculator built using Python and Tkinter. It supports basic arithmetic operations, advanced calculations like squares and cubes, and handles errors gracefully. The project showcases how Python can be used to create graphical user interfaces that are both functional and user-friendly.

## ✨ Features

- **Basic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Calculations**: Square (x²) and cube (x³) operations.
- **Error Handling**: Invalid inputs result in a clear "Error" message, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## 📚 Requirements

- Python 3.12.5
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kalmux1/Calculator.git
    cd Calculator
    ```

2. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

## 🛠️ How It Works

The calculator GUI is built using Tkinter, Python's standard GUI library. Here’s a brief overview of how the main components work:

- **click(event)**: Handles button clicks and processes user inputs.
- **eval()**: Evaluates the arithmetic expressions entered by the user.
- **Error Handling**: Catches exceptions and displays an error message if the input is invalid.
